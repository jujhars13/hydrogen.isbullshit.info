# Hydrodgen is bullsh\*\*t\*

(\*for most things)

## First, a quick primer

- Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe
- It's almost always bound to another element

### The different 'colours' of hydrodgen

| Colour            | Production                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| White             | Mining                              |
| Black             | Coal                                |
| Grey              | Steam reforming of methane          |
| Blue              | Steam reforming of methane w/ "CCS" |
| Green/Yellow/Pink | Electrolysis from Wind/Sun/Nuclear  |

- 830 Million Tonnes of Co2, 2% of global emissions
- only 1% is Blue hydrogen

### Myth - Hyrdogen for heating is bulls\*\*t

### Blended hydrogen for heating is bulls\*\*t

Blending of natural gas with 20% hydrogen in home heating systems, is a key recommendations by the government's hydrogen "champion", [Jane Toogood](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hydrogen-champion-appointed-as-government-accelerates-uk-hydrogen-investment)

> Using grid blending to shore up hydrogen demand creates unfair costs for consumers: A 20% hydrogen blend would increase gas costs by around 16%, while only reducing emissions by 7%, due to inefficiencies in burning hydrogen. -- [e3g.org]()
