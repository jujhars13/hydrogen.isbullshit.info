# Hydrodgen is bullsh\*\*t\*

## First, a quick primer

![](img/hydrogen-symbol.jpg)

- Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe
- It's almost always bound to another element, takes a lot of energy to separate it
- We've known about Hydrogen for a long time (lindenburg)

## The role of H

## What H is good for?

- Fertiliser
- Petrochemical production

No real alternatives here

## The different 'colours' of H

### The different 'colours' of H

| Colour            | Production                         | Co2e     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| White             | Mining                             | ?        |
| Black             | Coal                               | ?        |
| Grey              | Steam reforming methane            | 550g/kWh |
| Blue              | Steam reforming methane w/ "CCS"   | 486g/kWh |
| Green/Yellow/Pink | Electrolysis from Wind/Sun/Nuclear | 200g/kWh |

## Current H generation

![](img/hydrogen-chart.jpg)

- 830 Million Tonnes of Co2, 2% of global emissions
- only 1% is Blue hydrogen
- Burning methane directly produces between 400 to 600g/kWh

## H problems

## H problems

- It's really explosive

## Myth - H for short range transport is bulls\*\*t

- Two types: Electrolysis Vs Direct Combustion
- Pressure/Temp (Toyota/BMW)
- Cost

---DOWN

### Electrolysis based

- [Toyota FCHV-1 first released in 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fuel_cell_vehicles)
- Rare earth metals
- Speed 0 to 60mph (for a £50k car):
  - Toyota Mirai: 9.35s
  - Ford Mach-E: 3.8s

---DOWN

### Direct combustion

- NO (bad for health)

---DOWN

#### H based cost

£12 per kilo,~62 miles per kilo

So to do 62 Miles:

| power train          | cost/60 miles |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| Hydrogen Electrolsys | ~£11.40       |
| Hydrogen Combustion  | ~£22          |
| Diesel (40mpg)       | ~£11.49       |
| Petrol (40mpg)       | ~£10.02       |
| BEV (3 m/kWh)        | ~£7.20/£1.40  |

## Myth - H for long transport is bulls\*\*t

- Volume
- Kerosene is better until power/weight of batteries can come down

---

### Myth - H for heating is bulls\*\*t

- Hydrogen Embrittlement
- Twice as expensive as methane

---

## H is an excuse to keep polluting

- Saudi Aramco
- Bp
- Shell
- Total Energies
- Toyota
- Indian Oil

## In Summa

Hyrdrogen is good for this and not for this

### Blended hydrogen for heating is bulls\*\*t

Blending of natural gas with 20% hydrogen in home heating systems, is a key recommendations by the government's hydrogen "champion", [Jane Toogood](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hydrogen-champion-appointed-as-government-accelerates-uk-hydrogen-investment)

> Using grid blending to shore up hydrogen demand creates unfair costs for consumers: A 20% hydrogen blend would increase gas costs by around 16%, while only reducing emissions by 7%, due to inefficiencies in burning hydrogen. -- [e3g.org]()
