Hydrogen for personal transport is a load of bulls\\*\\*t

[![Deploy static content to Pages](https://github.com/jujhars13/hydrogen.isbullshit.info/actions/workflows/static-site-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jujhars13/hydrogen.isbullshit.info/actions/workflows/static-site-publish.yml)

## Deployment

Deploying using github pages (hence the unorthodox use of the `/docs/` directory for publishing)

## Building

```bash
# install deps locally
npm install

# to build prod release in /docs
# you'll need to git commit this
npm run build

# or dev workflow
# browse to http://localhost:8080/
npm run watch
npm run serve
```
